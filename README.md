**Les-Quizerables** is a trivia game with thousands of random questions pulled from an API for users who have registered an account and answered demographic questions. After each game, users can see relational graphs of scores v.s. user demographics, including age, education level, and location. There is also a live chat for clients to communicate with others connected to the server.
